<h1>Bioinformatics Essentials and Cookbook</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">
In this series, we are going to provide simple instructions to perform bioinformatics analysis on different datasets. We are also going to introduce basic principles of bioinformatics analysis and the statistical and mathematical concepts behind some of the widely used bioinformatics tools.
We will focus on using R, python and Unix as the essential platforms for bioinformatics. We will try to simplify complex tasks and introduce topics mainly for biologists who have very limited knowledge of programming. The focus of this channel is applied bioinformatics. We are not trying to develop new tools or do intensive programming. We will use well established tools to analyze sequencing data and try to interpret bioinformatics graphs and results.
